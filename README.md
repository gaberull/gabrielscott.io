# Purpose of this Repository

This repository is being used for the purposes of hosting assets to be embedded on [gabrielscott.io](https://gabrielscott.io)

gabrielscott.io is being run from a separate server. Specifically a GCP Compute Engine Virtual Machine with somewhat limited processing power, due to being part of their 'free tier'.


This way, I can use GitHub's servers to share the work load when it comes to hosting files.
